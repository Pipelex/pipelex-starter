# Rules to choose LLM models used in PipeLLMs.

## LLM Handles

In order to use it in a pipe, an LLM is referenced by its llm_handle and possibly by an llm_preset.
Both llm_handles and llm_presets are defined in this toml config file: [base_llm_deck.toml](mdc:pipelex/libraries/llm_deck/base_llm_deck.toml)

## LLM Handles

An llm_handle matches the handle (an id of sorts) with the full specification of the LLM to use, i.e.:
- llm_name
- llm_version
- llm_platform_choice

The declaration of llm_handles looks like this in toml syntax:
```toml
[llm_handles]
gpt-4o-2024-11-20 = { llm_name = "gpt-4o", llm_version = "2024-11-20" }
```

In mosty cases, we only want to use version "latest" and llm_platform_choice "default" in which case the declaration is simply a match of the llm_handle to the llm_name, like this:
```toml
best-claude = "claude-4-opus"
best-gemini = "gemini-2.5-pro"
best-mistral = "mistral-large"
```

And of course, llm_handles are automatically assigned for all models by their name, with version "latest" and llm_platform_choice "default".

## Using an LLM Handle in a PipeLLM

Here is an example of using an llm_handle to specify which LLM to use in a PipeLLM:

```plx
[pipe.hello_world]
type = "PipeLLM"
definition = "Write text about Hello World."
output = "Text"
llm = { llm_handle = "gpt-4o-mini", temperature = 0.9, max_tokens = "auto" }
prompt_template = """
Write a haiku about Hello World.
"""
```

As you can see, to use the LLM, you must also indicate the temperature (float between 0 and 1) and max_tokens (either an int or the string "auto").

## LLM Presets

Presets are meant to record the choice of an llm with its hyper parameters (temperature and max_tokens) if it's good for a particular task. LLM Presets are skill-oriented.

Examples:
```toml
llm_to_reason = { llm_handle = "o4-mini", temperature = 1, max_tokens = "auto" }
llm_to_extract_invoice = { llm_handle = "claude-3-7-sonnet", temperature = 0.1, max_tokens = "auto" }
```

The interest is that these presets can be used to set the LLM choice in a PipeLLM, like this:

```plx
[pipe.extract_invoice]
type = "PipeLLM"
definition = "Extract invoice information from an invoice text transcript"
inputs = { invoice_text = "InvoiceText" }
output = "Invoice"
llm = "llm_to_extract_invoice"
prompt_template = """
Extract invoice information from this invoice:

The category of this invoice is: $invoice_details.category.

@invoice_text
"""
```

The setting here `llm = "llm_to_extract_invoice"` works because "llm_to_extract_invoice" has been declared as an llm_preset in the deck.
You must not use an LLM preset in a PipeLLM that does not exist in the deck. If needed, you can add llm presets.


You can override the predefined llm presets in [overrides.toml](your/path/to/pipelex/config/folder/llm_deck/overrides.toml).
