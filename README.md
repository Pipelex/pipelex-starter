### Use this template

This is a template repository: don't clone it, click the green `Use this template` button at the top-right of the Github repo page.
Once you've created your repository from it, then you can clone it and follow the instructions below:

---

### Create virtual environment, install Pipelex and other dependencies

```bash
make install
```

This will install the Pipelex python library and its dependencies using uv.

### Set up environment variables

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Enter your API keys into your `.env` file. The `OPENAI_API_KEY` is enough to get you started, but some pipelines require models from other providers.
