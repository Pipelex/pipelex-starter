      "text": "Show HN: MTHDS – Beyond skills: a typed DSL for executable AI methods\n\nTLDR\n\nMTHDS is a declarative language for defining AI methods: discrete, reusable units of cognitive work like extraction, analysis, synthesis, generation. It is built on TOML and introduces two primitives: concepts (semantically typed data named after real domain things) and pipes (deterministic orchestration steps with explicit typed inputs and outputs). Pipes can invoke LLMs, VLMs, OCR, and image generation models, with built-in structured generation.\n\nThe typing is conceptual: NonCompeteClause is a refinement of ContractClause, meaning pipes compose wherever types are compatible, without manual glue code, because the types carry business meaning rather than just structure.\n\nMethods are executable and composable like Unix tools: a method can be saved as a CLI command, combined with others using standard Unix pipes, or invoked directly by Claude Code. Methods can also be published as packages, used as templates to customize, or called as components from other methods. Teams can share some methods openly and keep their secret sauce private.\n\nThe standard ships with a Claude Code plugin that lets Claude write, modify, and compose methods on your behalf. This makes MTHDS agent-first by design: a domain expert who can describe what they need in plain language can have Claude author the method, which then runs consistently, is testable, and lives in version control.\n\nWhere agent skills handle open-ended tasks, methods handle the parts that benefit from being explicit, versioned, and validated. And unlike skills, methods are executable outside the scope of an agent entirely."
