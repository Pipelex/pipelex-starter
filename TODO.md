# Joke Generator Pipeline - TODO

## Plan Implementation Steps

- [x] Create pipeline definition file (`pipelex_libraries/pipelines/joke_generator.plx`)
- [x] Create example runner script (`my_project/joke_generator.py`)
- [x] Validate pipeline using `make validate` âœ… (Passed without errors)
- [ ] Test pipeline execution (Requires API key configuration)
- [ ] Verify joke generation works as expected

## Current Status
Pipeline files created and validated successfully. 
Network connectivity issue indicates missing OpenAI API key configuration.

## Next Steps for User
To complete the setup and test the joke generator:
1. Configure OpenAI API key in the `.env` file
2. Run `python my_project/joke_generator.py` to test the pipeline
